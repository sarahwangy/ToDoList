# ToDoList

## Description:

This is a small react project that can enable users to add todo list, click the list if the stuff has been finished, then delete the lists that have been
completed one by one using 'delete' button. Meanwhile, there is a 'status' button in the bottom part, which can show users how many lists have been completed.
Lastly, the 'clear finished tasks' button can remove all checked tasks immediately.
